      <h1>Beginner Cue Sports</h1>
      <p>
        I would like to document a few of the aiming techniques I have learned so far to play pool.
        I first started with Ghost Ball Aiming then transitioned to Shaft Aiming and then eventually onto Contact Point Aiming.
        Currently I use a combination of all three into my own system which I will also document, which I call Online Aiming.
        Before we can even consider aiming techniques, it is useful to determine how we sight the balls.
        Since billiards and pool(now to be only referenced as billiards) is different
        from most sports in that it requires the eyes to notice two balls instead of one.
        This complicates things and we must adjust our eye pattern, hit precisely on the cue ball and the object(target) ball, as well as notice the pocket we are aiming into.
        The first section will go through the dominant eye tests as well as highlight sighting issues players have.
        It will also contain an eye pattern that we will use to hit accurately.
        The second section will look at grip, elbow, and bridges.
        The third section will look at the basic aiming techniques.
        The fourth section will look at body alignment which in my opinion is critical to the game.
