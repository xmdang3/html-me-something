    <h1>Dominant Eye Test</h1>
    <h3>A problem, an amateur or professional player, don't even know they have!</h3>
    <p>
      Due to the individual nature of our eyes, everyone has a different eye strength and eye dominance.
      This has a huge impact on the sighting line in relation to the actual line of aim when we use both eyes to aim.
      The sighting line is determined by your individual eye dominance.
      When looking at two round objects straight onto each other such as two billard balls or even two round discs, the image may appear straight on.
      However, each eye can be offset by some distance, large or small, causing the actual line to be shifted in one direction.
      To correct this, we need to step a degree to the left or to the right in order to make the balls/discs line up properly straight!
      This position behind the two objects we will call the sighting line.
    </p>

    <h4>Dominant Eye Test Steps</h4>
    <img src="images/R1 - Eye Align Test/Screen Shot 2020-07-05 at 4.41.56 PM.png" />
    <p>
      Lets sets this icon 2 meters away and at eye level.
    </p>
    <img src="images/R1 - Eye Align Test/Screen Shot 2020-07-05 at 4.42.05 PM.png" />
    <p>
      Use both eyes and fully extend the left hand, cover the icon with your thumb.
    </p>
    <img src="images/R1 - Eye Align Test/Screen Shot 2020-07-05 at 4.42.23 PM.png" />
    <p>
      Without moving, close your left eye. Notice what happens. It may appear like this. The thumb has moved slightly to the left. Thus exposing more of the icon. This is the image seen by the right eye!
    </p>
    <img src="images/R1 - Eye Align Test/Screen Shot 2020-07-05 at 4.42.44 PM.png" />
    <p>
      Now lets try with the right eye closed. The thumb may have moved slightly to the right! Exposing more of the icon to the left! This is the image seen by the left eye.
    </p>
    <img src="images/R1 - Eye Align Test/Screen Shot 2020-07-05 at 4.43.10 PM.png" />
    <img src="images/R1 - Eye Align Test/Screen Shot 2020-07-05 at 4.43.21 PM.png" />
    <p>
      Each eye sees a slightly different visual.
      The central line is used to compare of what we actually see and what is actually centered.
    </p>
    <img src="images/R1 - Eye Align Test/Screen Shot 2020-07-05 at 4.44.10 PM.png" />
    <img src ="images/R1 - Eye Align Test/Screen Shot 2020-07-05 at 4.44.23 PM.png" />
    <p>
      With both images captured, the brain merges the two images into one visual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thats simple right? There is actually a bit more to it.
      Unfortunately, perfect balanced vision is extremely rare!
      The previous example assumes both eyes are of equal strength!
      Meaning, each eye is offset by an equal amount and thus work evenly to bring the two images to merge.
      99% of people's eyes will NOT be of equal strength!
      That is why eye dominance becomes a factor to your sight and sighting line!
    </p>
    <img src="images/R1 - Eye Align Test/Screen Shot 2020-07-05 at 4.45.28 PM.png" />
    <p>
      This next example shows two images merging at differant rates.
      Here the right eye is stronger than the left.
      Therefore makes the left eye work harder or travel further to create a focused visual.
      As a result, the focus point occurs the the right of the central line.
      This is known as right eye dominance.
    </p>
    <img src="images/R1 - Eye Align Test/Screen Shot 2020-07-05 at 4.45.45 PM.png" />
    <img src="images/R1 - Eye Align Test/Screen Shot 2020-07-05 at 4.45.51 PM.png" />
    <p>
      The stronger the right eye, the further to the right the visual will merge to create the focus point.
    </p>
    <img src = "images/R1 - Eye Align Test/Screen Shot 2020-07-05 at 4.46.07 PM.png" />
    <p>
      The opposite can be seen for left eye dominance. Thus making the focus point to the left of the central line.
    </p>
    <img src="images/R1 - Eye Align Test/Screen Shot 2020-07-05 at 4.46.20 PM.png" />
    <img src= "images/R1 - Eye Align Test/Screen Shot 2020-07-05 at 4.46.29 PM.png" />
    <p>
      Again, the stronger the left eye over the right eye, the  further to the eft the merge focus point will take place.
    </p>
    <p>
       As a reuslt, eye dominance has a huge impact on how we see things and more importantly how we sight or aim using both eyes at the same time. Now we get to use this information to improve our aim. Check out the next section for more information on finding the sighting line knowing our eye dominance!

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Stand 2 meters from a target at eye level.
      </li>
      <li>
        Raise a thumb to cover to the target.
      </li>
      <li>
        Close one eye at a time and determine which eye has the thumb closest to the target. That will be considered your dominant eye.
      </li>
